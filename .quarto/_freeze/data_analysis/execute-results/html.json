Additionally, there is a signficant dip in life expectancy for all countries around 2020-2021. This is likely an effect of the COVID-19 global pandemic. According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news/item/24-05-2024-covid-19-eliminated-a-decade-of-progress-in-global-level-of-life-expectancy), global life expectancy deceased 1.8 years to 71.4 years from 2019 to 2021, which is similar to the life expectancy we saw in 2012. This, which we can see in @fig-1, is approximately true for our selection of countries.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-1 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Life Expectancy Rate by Country Over Time\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.lineplot(\n    data=df,\n    x=\"year\",\n    y=\"life_expectancy\",\n    hue=\"country\",\n    marker=\"o\"\n)\n\nplt.title(\"Life Expectancy Over Time by Country\", fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Life Expectancy (Years)\")\nplt.legend(title=\"Country\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Life Expectancy from 2000 - 2023](data_analysis_files/figure-html/fig-1-output-1.png){#fig-1 width=949 height=563}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhile we see some general parallels, the life expectancy within these countries still vary drastically. @fig-2 depicts the selection of countries in order, from low-income, to lower-middle, to upper-middle, and to high. The height of the bars represents average life expectancy from more recent years, 2017 - 2023. People in high income countries have higher life expectancies than those in low income countries. In other words, life expectancy seems to be positively linked with a country's GNI.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-2 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Bar plot of average life expectancy per country\navg_life_exp = (\n    df[df['year'].between(2017, 2023)]\n    .groupby(\"country\")[\"life_expectancy\"]\n    .mean()\n    .reset_index()\n)\n\ncountry_order = ['Afghanistan', 'Kenya', 'India', 'Brazil', 'United Kingdom']\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nsns.barplot(data=avg_life_exp, x=\"country\", y=\"life_expectancy\", order=country_order)\nplt.title(\"Average Life Expectancy (2017–2023) by Country\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Average Life Expectancy (Years)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Country\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Average Life Expectancy from 2017 - 2023](data_analysis_files/figure-html/fig-2-output-1.png){#fig-2 width=757 height=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA table of these average life expectancies is also shown in @tbl-1. High-income countries, such as the United Kingdom, have generally higher life expectancy. The United Kingdom life expectancy hovers near the top edge of the plot in @fig-1, and in @tbl-1, we see that it has a high average life expectancy of around 81.0 years. However, for low-income countries, such as Afghanistan, we see a significantly lower life expectancy of around 63.0 years. Thus, again, there appears to be a rather strong correlation between a country's income level and their life expectancy.\n\n::: {#tbl-1 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Average Life Expectancy by Country\n\ntable_1 = (\n    df[df['year'].between(2017, 2023)]\n    .groupby('country', as_index=False)['life_expectancy']\n    .mean()\n    .round(3)\n)\ntable_1.columns = ['Country', 'Average Life Expectancy (2017–2023)']\ntable_1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Country</th>\n      <th>Average Life Expectancy (2017–2023)</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Afghanistan</td>\n      <td>63.045</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Brazil</td>\n      <td>75.013</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>India</td>\n      <td>70.338</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Kenya</td>\n      <td>62.644</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n      <td>81.016</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n\nAverage Life Expectancy from 2017 - 2023\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Adolescent Fertility Analysis\n\nOur second indicator for population dynamics is adolescent fertility rate. @fig-3 shows adolescent fertility rates over time for our selection of countries. There appear to be drastic decreases for lower and lower-middle countries, such as India. Notably, India had high adolescent fertility rates, comparable to those of Afghanistan and Kenya in 2000, but decreased quickly, and currently has a much low adolescent fertility rate. India's improvement, as well as the decreases in adolescent fertility rates for other non-high-income countries (Afghanistan, Kenya, and Brazil) demonstrates a level of global improvement on this indicator.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-3 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Adolescent Fertility Rate by Country Over Time\n\n# Prepare the data for plotting\npivot_df = df.pivot(index='year', columns='country', values='adolescent_fertility')\n\n# Plot the line graph\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\npivot_df.plot(ax=plt.gca(), marker='o')\nplt.title('Adolescent Fertility Rate by Country Over Time')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Adolescent Fertility Rate')\nplt.legend(title='Country', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')\nplt.xticks(pivot_df.index, rotation=45)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Adolescent Fertility Rates from 2000 - 2023](data_analysis_files/figure-html/fig-3-output-1.png){#fig-3 width=1140 height=757}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Adolescent Fertility and Secondary School Enrollment\n\nStill, as shown in @tbl-2, there are signficantly wide gaps in adolescent fertility rates between lower- and higher-income countries. The United Kingdom has an average rate of approximately 10.1, whereas Afghanistan has a rate of around 70. This is a drastic difference, and one that still needs contionous attention and amendment.\n\n::: {#tbl-2 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Average Adolescent Fertility Rate by Country\n\ntable_2 = (\n    df[df['year'].between(2017, 2023)]\n    .groupby('country', as_index=False)['adolescent_fertility']\n    .mean()\n    .round(3)\n)\ntable_2.columns = ['Country', 'Average Adolescent Fertility (2017–2023)']\ntable_2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Country</th>\n      <th>Average Adolescent Fertility (2017–2023)</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Afghanistan</td>\n      <td>69.167</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Brazil</td>\n      <td>48.643</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>India</td>\n      <td>14.579</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Kenya</td>\n      <td>61.568</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n      <td>10.161</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n\nAverage Adolescent Fertility Rates from 2017 - 2023\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn addition to looking at adolescent fertility rates over time, we will examine how these rates interact with secondary school enrollment.\n\nAdolescent fertility rates consider girls ages 15 - 19. Most of these years align with secondary-school-enrollment years, which is typically around the 14 - 18 age range. Education can  better students' knowledge of reproductive health and the importance of contraception, and empower women to focus on their academics and career, which may delay child marriage. So, we will observe how education (secondary school enrollment, in particular) interacts with adolescent fertility rates in different countries.\n\n@fig-4 shows the adolescent fertility and secondary-school-enrollment rates over time. We chose the countries of India and the United Kingdom based on their income-level designations (lower-middle and high, respectively) as well as their availablity of secondary-school-enrollment data compared to other countries.\n\nFor India, as secondary school enrollment steadily increases, the adolescent fertility rate decreases quite drastically, suggesting an inverse correlation between these two variables. For the United Kingdom,\nwe see an increase in enrollment rates through the years, as well as a slight decrease in adolescent fertility, reflecting said inverse correlation. Additionally, enrollment rates have been relatively high and adolescent fertility rates low from 2000 - 2023, further emphasizing this inverse correlation. Considering both countries' plots, increasing secondary school enrollment is likely highly associated with decreasing adolescent fertility rates.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-4 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Adolescent Fertility Rate and Secondary School Enrollment\n\n# Prepare the data for plotting\npivot_df_adolescent_fertility = df.pivot(index='year', columns='country', values='adolescent_fertility')\npivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment = df.pivot(index='year', columns='country', values='secondary_school_enrollment')\n\n# Plot the graphs\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6), sharex=True, sharey=True)\n\n# India\naxes[0].plot(\n    pivot_df_adolescent_fertility.index,\n    pivot_df_adolescent_fertility['India'],\n    marker='o',\n    label='Adolescent Fertility Rate',\n    color='tab:blue'\n)\naxes[0].plot(\n    pivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment.index,\n    pivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment['India'],\n    marker='s',\n    label='Secondary School Enrollment',\n    color='tab:orange'\n)\naxes[0].set_title('India')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Year')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Rate')\naxes[0].legend()\naxes[0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n\n# United Kingdom\naxes[1].plot(\n    pivot_df_adolescent_fertility.index,\n    pivot_df_adolescent_fertility['United Kingdom'],\n    marker='o',\n    label='Adolescent Fertility Rate',\n    color='tab:blue'\n)\naxes[1].plot(\n    pivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment.index,\n    pivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment['United Kingdom'],\n    marker='s',\n    label='Secondary School Enrollment',\n    color='tab:orange'\n)\naxes[1].set_title('United Kingdom')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Year')\naxes[1].legend()\naxes[1].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n\nfig.suptitle('Adolescent Fertility Rate and Secondary School Enrollment\\n(India and United Kingdom)', fontsize=16)\nplt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Adolescent Fertility and Secondary School Enrollment Rates: India and United Kingdom](data_analysis_files/figure-html/fig-4-output-1.png){#fig-4 width=1333 height=550}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Under-5 Mortality Rate Analysis\n\nOur final indicator is under-5 mortality rate. @fig-5 shows the under-5 mortality rate for our selected countries over time.

We see more improvement as income-level increases. For Brazil, an upper-middle-income country, the under-5 mortality rate is 14.9, and for the United Kingdom, a high-income country, the rate is very low, at 4.4.
