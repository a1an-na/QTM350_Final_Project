QTM 350 Final Project: Population Dynamics Across Income Levels

Group Members:
- Alan Na 
- Jennifer Gu 

This project explores global population dynamics by analyzing three key health-related indicators from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database across five countries with varying income levels:

- Countries: Afghanistan, Kenya, India, Brazil, United Kingdom  
- Indicators:
  - Life Expectancy at Birth (`SP.DYN.LE00.IN`)
  - Under-5 Mortality Rate (`SH.DYN.MORT`)
  - Adolescent Fertility Rate (`SP.ADO.TFRT`)

We compare these indicators over time (2000–2023) to evaluate how population health outcomes differ across income levels.
