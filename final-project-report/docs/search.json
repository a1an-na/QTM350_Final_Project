Examples of these characteristics include birth and death rates, age distributions, and population size and density. Most importantly, population dynamics help us understand how and why populations evolve in structure and makeup, and allow us to consider how changes in populations interact with key components of human societies, such as economics, public health, and government.\nThis project aims to explore the population dynamics between five countires of ranging income values: Afghanistan, Kenya, India, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. Using data from the World Bank, we analyze three key indicators: life expectancy, adolescent fertility rate, and under-5 mortality rate from 2000 to 2023.\nThe primary research question we focus on is: How do population dynamics compare between countries of different income levels?\nWe find that higher-income countries tend to have higher life expectancy and lower mortality and fertility rates. While lower-income countries display the opposite trend, highlighting the strong connection between income level and population health outcome."

    "text": "Life Expectancy, Adolescent Fertility, and Under-5 Mortality\nFinally, we will look at the interactions between all three of our indicators for our selection of countries over time. The following is an interactive bubble chart with under-5 mortality rate on the x-axis, adolescent fertility rate on the y-axis, and life expectancy as bubble size. Note that life expectancy has been normalized in order to better visualize the change from 2000 - 2023. Also, 0.01 was added to this normalization of life expectancy in order to avoid a minimum of 0 years. Our goal in creating this bubble chart is to better visualize the trends and comparisons we discussed throughout our analysis.\nAs we progress through time, we see the general trend of increasing life expectancy (the bubble grow larger) and decreasing adolescent fertility as well as under-5 mortality (the bubbles move toward the origin of the graph). This reflects a global improvement for all countries, particularly those of non-high income levels. The comparitively lower levels of change for Brazil and especially the United Kingdom are due to their relatively stronger population dyamics throughout 2000 - 2023, which is depicted through its close proximity to the origin.\nAdditionally, we also see all the bubbles shrink in 2020 and 2021, and grow back afterward, indicating the affect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFinally, if we pause on 2023, we can see that the countries, while having improved quite a lot since 2000, still appear in order of income level. Afghanistan still hasn’t reached an under-5 mortality rate lower than that of Brazil’s in 2000, and Kenya has only made small improvements to life expectancy compared to other countries. While high-income countries have continuously high life expectancies and lower adolescent fertility and under-5 mortality rates, countries of lower income levels not only face weaker indicators, but it’s also more difficult for them to break existing structures and reach the ideal.\n\n\nCode\n# We will use pandas and plotly for this figure.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Read the dataset.\ndf = pd.read_csv('population_dynamics_clean.csv')\n\n# Normalize the life expectancy column to see clearer changes\n# 0.01 is added to avoid a minimum value of 0\ndf['life_expectancy_norm'] = 0.01 + (df['life_expectancy'] - df['life_expectancy'].min()) / (df['life_expectancy'].max() - df['life_expectancy'].min())\n\n# Create an animated scatter plot/bubble chart\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df,\n    x = \"under5_mortality\",\n    y = \"adolescent_fertility\",\n    title = \"Life Expectancy, Under-5 Mortality, and Adolescent Fertility Rate Over Time\",\n    size = 'life_expectancy_norm',\n    color = 'country',\n    color_discrete_map = {\n        'Brazil': '#ff7f0e',\n        'India': 'green',\n        'Kenya': 'red',\n        'United Kingdom': '#9467bd',\n        'Afghanistan': '#1f77b4'\n    },\n    hover_name = 'country',\n    size_max = 60,\n    animation_frame = 'year',\n    animation_group ='country',\n    labels={\n        \"under5_mortality\": \"Under-5 Mortality Rate\",\n        \"adolescent_fertility\": \"Adolescent Fertility Rate\",\n        \"life_expectancy_norm\": \"Life Expectancy (Normalized)\"\n    }\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 1: Life Expectancy, Adolescent Fertility, and Under-5 Mortality from 2000 - 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder-5 Mortality and Adolescent Fertility\nIntuitively, this makes sense, as adolescent fertility is associated with complications during childbirth. Adolescents, too, tend to be less suitable caretakers due to a lack of money and resources. Complications during childbirth as well as inefficient infant care can lead to child mortality. Thus, seeing a decrease in adolescent fertility would also likely come with a decrease in under-5 mortality.\n[Consider income-related effects]\n\n\nLimitations\nWhy does India have very low average adolescent fertility rate (much lower than Brazil, closer to the UK)?\nHowever, while India has reached an adolescent fertility rate comparable to that of the United Kingdom, it’s enrollment rate is still relatively lower. Other variables, such as marital age and access to contraceptives, may have an affect as well. In addition, there could also be limitations to data collection in countries with lower income; if less information is collected on the adolescent fertility rate, there may be potential innaccuracies."

Most of these years align with secondary-school-enrollment years, which is typically around the 14 - 18 age range. Education can better knowledge of reproductive health and the importance of contraception, and empower women to focus on their academics and career, which may delay child marriage. So, we will observe how education (secondary school enrollment, in particular) interacts with adolescent fertility rates in different countries.\nIn addition, it’s important to note that a country’s access to education generally correlates with their GNI, as more money can be invested in schools and teachers. On the other hand, greater access to education is known to improve a country’s economy as well, by increasing human capital and innovation.\nFigure 4 shows the adolescent fertility and secondary-school-enrollment rates over time. We chose the countries of India and the United Kingdom based on their income-level designations (lower-middle and high, respectively) as well as their availablity of secondary-school-enrollment data compared to other countries.\nFor India, as secondary school enrollment steadily increases, the adolescent fertility rate decreases quite drastically, suggesting an inverse correlation between these two variables. For the United Kingdom, we see an increase in enrollment rates through the years, as well as a slight decrease in adolescent fertility, reflecting said inverse correlation. Additionally, enrollment rates have been relatively high and adolescent fertility rates low from 2000 - 2023, further emphasizing this inverse correlation. Considering both countries’ plots, increasing secondary school enrollment is likely highly associated with decreasing adolescent fertility rates.\n\n\nCode\n# Adolescent Fertility Rate and Secondary School Enrollment\n\n# Prepare the data for plotting\npivot_df_adolescent_fertility = df.pivot(index='year', columns='country', values='adolescent_fertility')\npivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment = df.pivot(index='year', columns='country', values='secondary_school_enrollment')\n\n# Plot the graphs\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6), sharex=True, sharey=True)\n\n# India\naxes[0].plot(\n    pivot_df_adolescent_fertility.index,\n    pivot_df_adolescent_fertility['India'],\n    marker='o',\n    label='Adolescent Fertility Rate',\n    color='tab:blue'\n)\naxes[0].plot(\n    pivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment.index,\n    pivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment['India'],\n    marker='s',\n    label='Secondary School Enrollment',\n    color='tab:orange'\n)\naxes[0].set_title('India')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Year')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Rate')\naxes[0].legend()\naxes[0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n\n# United Kingdom\naxes[1].plot(\n    pivot_df_adolescent_fertility.index,\n    pivot_df_adolescent_fertility['United Kingdom'],\n    marker='o',\n    label='Adolescent Fertility Rate',\n    color='tab:blue'\n)\naxes[1].plot(\n    pivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment.index,\n    pivot_df_secondary_school_enrollment['United Kingdom'],\n    marker='s',\n    label='Secondary School Enrollment',\n    color='tab:orange'\n)\naxes[1].set_title('United Kingdom')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Year')\naxes[1].legend()\naxes[1].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n\nfig.suptitle('Adolescent Fertility Rate and Secondary School Enrollment\\n(India and United Kingdom)', fontsize=16)\nplt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Adolescent Fertility and Secondary School Enrollment Rates: India and United Kingdom"

    "text": "We used data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) to examine population dynamics across five countries: Afghanistan, Kenya, India, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. These countries were selected to represent income levels ranging from low-income to high-income, based on the World Bank’s Classification of the world by income and region. Specifically, Afghanistan is low-income, Kenya and India and lower-middle income, Brazil is upper-middle income, and the United Kingdom is classified as high-income. This allows for meaningful comparisons across development contexts.\nWe focused specifically on three indicators ranging from 2000 to 2023. Below are the indicators and their unique WDI codes:\n\nLife expectancy at birth (SP.DYN.LE00.IN)\nAdolescent fertility rate (SP.ADO.TFRT)\nUnder-5 mortality rate (SH.DYN.MORT)\n\nWe also included the secondary school enrollment indicator (SE.SEC.ENRR) to use for our analysis on adolescent fertility.\nThe data was accessed via the wbdata Python package and cleaned using SQL. We filtered the data to include only the selected countries and relevant years. We reshaped the dataset from long to wide format, with each row representing a single country-year observation and separate columns for each indicator.\nThe final variables in our dataset are:\n\ncountry: country name (e.g., “India”)\nyear: year of observation (2000–2023)\nlife_expectancy: average years at birth\nadolescent_fertility: births per 1,000 women aged 15–19\nunder5_mortality: deaths per 1,000 live births\nsecondary_school_enrollment: ratio of students enrolled in secondary school to the population of the age group\n\nBelow are our summary statistics for our three primary indicators:\n\nAverage Life Expectancy by Country (2000–2023)\n\n\n\nCountry\nMean\nMin\nMedian\nMax\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n80.09\n77.74\n80.52\n81.37\n\n\nBrazil\n73.44\n69.58\n73.91\n75.85\n\n\nIndia\n67.45\n62.75\n67.45\n72.00\n\n\nKenya\n60.53\n56.08\n61.25\n63.65\n\n\nAfghanistan\n60.49\n55.00\n60.98\n66.04\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder-5 Mortality Rate by Country (2000–2023)\n\n\n\nCountry\nMean\nMin\nMedian\nMax\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n5.18\n4.40\n4.90\n6.50\n\n\nBrazil\n20.18\n14.40\n17.55\n34.50\n\n\nIndia\n55.70\n27.70\n53.50\n91.60\n\n\nKenya\n58.16\n39.90\n51.70\n96.30\n\n\nAfghanistan\n87.44\n55.50\n82.90\n131.70\n\n\n\n\n\nAdolescent Fertility Rate by Country (2000–2023)\n\n\n\nCountry\nMean\nMin\nMedian\nMax\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n19.28\n8.36\n20.88\n28.73\n\n\nIndia\n46.11\n14.06\n40.16\n114.35\n\n\nBrazil\n64.43\n42.69\n64.53\n85.61\n\n\nKenya\n93.82\n56.31\n102.42\n123.25\n\n\nAfghanistan\n102.32\n64.07\n98.45\n154.31"

    "text": "Our analysis reveals a distinct relationship between a country’s income level and its population health indicators. High-income countries such as the United Kingdom tend to have higher life expectancy and lower under-5 mortality and adolescent fertility rates. Low and middle-income countries such as Afghanistan and Kenya show the opposite trends. Such disparities highlight the importance of investment in healthcare, education, and social infrastructure to improve population outcomes.\nOur analysis only focused on five countries, future work could expand the dataset to include more countries and explore regional trends or changes before and after major global events (e.g., COVID-19). Additionally, incorporating other relevant variables, such as healthcare spending, education levels, or urbanization, could further a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers behind population health."
